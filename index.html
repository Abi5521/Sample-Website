        <h3>-Steve Jobs</h3>
        <h2>Introduction</h2><hr>
    <p >Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, inventor, <br>and investor best known for co-founding the technology giant Apple Inc. Jobs was also the founder <br>of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer <br>revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder <br>Steve Wozniak.</p>
    <h2>Innovations and Design</h2><hr>
    <p>Jobs's design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and Buddhism. In India, he experienced <br>Buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey and his sense of intuition was influenced by the <br>spiritual people with whom he studied. Jobs gained insights regarding industrial designs from Richard Sapper.
        <br><br>According to Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, "Steve didn't ever code. He wasn't an engineer and he didn't do <br>any original design...". Daniel Kottke, one of Apple's earliest employees and a college friend of Jobs, stated: <br> "Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing person."

        <p>Although entirely designed by Steve Wozniak, Jobs had the idea of selling the desktop computer, which led to <br>the formation of Apple Computer in 1976. Both Jobs and Wozniak constructed several of the Apple I <br>prototypes by hand, funded by selling some of their belongings. Eventually, 200 units were produced.</p>   
        <b><li style="text-align: center; width: 60px;">Apple 2</li></b>
        <p>The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the world's first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer <br>products, designed primarily by Wozniak while Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's unusual case and <br>Rod Holt developed the unique power supply. It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by <br>Jobs and Wozniak as the first consumer product sold by Apple.</p>  
        <b><li style="text-align: center; width: 78px;">Apple Lisa</li></b>
        <p>The Lisa is a personal computer developed by Apple from 1978 and sold in the early 1980s. It is the first personal <br>computer with a graphical user interface for business users. The Lisa sold poorly at 100,000 units.
            In 1982, after <br>Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project, he took over the Macintosh project, adding inspiration from Lisa. The final <br>Lisa 2/10 was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL.</p>
